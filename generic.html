						<h2> General Problem</h2>
						<p>
							Macular Degeneration is a deterioration of the central portion of the retina. The macular is  part of the retina in the inner eye and contains a high density of photoreceptor cells. If this part deteriorates a growing blind spot forms that significantly affects vision.
							The condition is a dying off of nerve cells in the macula. Once dead, these cells cannot be repaired. Macular Degeneration is a leading cause of vision loss in the USA. It can be caused by multiple reasons e.g. related to smoking, race, or genetics, but is very often age related. Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss among persons over 50 years.
							<br />
							<br />
							This is an exploratory VR-based visualization project that proposes a new way of digital enhancement. It will be a design project aimed at experts at the Emory Eye Center to help us to optimize the VR interface. We do not yet target clinical trials but aim to create the necessary prototype for a possible pilot study.
							We will use recently released commercial VR equipment (HTC Vive Pro Eye) to build an experimental set up investigating digital media opportunities for people affected by Macular Degeneration.
							Its user scenario is for at home media use. Our design will support reading, writing, watching TV, and computer interactions. Currently these are supported by special magnifying technologies. Our approach is to warp the image through interactive mapping in the VR visualization to optimize it for each eye’s remaining active retina. This differs in its design from magnification alone and potentially offers a new venue in this area.
							It has been shown that vision warping is eventually corrected by the brain to create a produce a complete picture of the world around. To explore this, we will create a prototype with the support of the Emory Eye Care Center for this case in AMD. We will initially work with fully digitally produced VR images but if these prove effective, we should have little problem to include e.g. a live feed from a HD camera mounted on the VR set.

						<h2>Existing Work</h2>
						<p>
							Existing treatments largely target a slowing down of the deterioration. They include in-eye-injections, nutritional supplements (AREDS). Depending on the particular case, other treatment consists of laser surgery or photodynamic therapy – both techniques are invasive and can have adversarial side effects. There are additional, still experimental, surgical approaches. There is no cure or reversal of this process.
							Since 2010 the FDA has approved special implantable miniature telescope (IMT) prosthetic devices into eyes. There are different techniques depending on the implant, but basically the IMT implant sits in the eye and adjusts the image before it hits the macula.
							Most supportive non-invasive methods consist of devices such as specialized glasses and other magnifying technologies. The closest related work to the here proposed work are digitally enhanced magnifying devices.
							See, for example: https://www.enhancedvision.com/low-vision-product-line/jordy.html or https://www.esighteyewear.com or https://nueyes.com/. To our knowledge, no product applies the approach found in this probject.

						<h2>Specific problem</h2>
						<p>
							<strong> There are a number of challenges in the existing solutions:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Simple magnification only works to a certain degree. E.g. HD camera’s zoom effect in digital devices does not improve resolution – none of the projects has an optical zoom. </li>
								<li>Patients might have different conditions on different eyes. Particularly among older patients their macular might be differently affected. No project addresses this. </li>
								<li>Macular degeneration is a process. It can progress at different speeds for different patients. Different changes can manifest over time and these differences are not accounted for in most projects, nor do they offer variable adjustments.
								<li>Patients might not need the improvements in the same way all the time. For example, patients can have acceptable vision to navigate and recognize overall shapes in their everyday life. Medium to far vision but might be still acceptable but they might need specific support for near vision tasks. We will initially focus on one specific use case: media interaction at home.</li>
								<li>All of the existent options are expensive. This is even more pressing as most of them are not covered by insurances, as far as I can tell.</li>
							</ul>
